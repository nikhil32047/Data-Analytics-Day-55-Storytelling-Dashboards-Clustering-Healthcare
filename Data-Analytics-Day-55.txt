Advanced Data Analytics Lessons

🔹 Lesson 1: Data Storytelling & Insights
========================================
Summary:
Raw analysis isn’t enough — insights must be communicated effectively. Use narratives, visuals, and clear takeaways to tell the story.

Example: Instead of “Revenue grew 15%,” say → “Revenue grew 15%, mainly due to a 25% rise in festive season sales.”


🔹 Lesson 2: Interactive Dashboards (Power BI / Tableau)
====================================================
Summary:
Dashboards make data exploration easier for stakeholders.
Filters & slicers
Drill-down charts
KPIs and alerts

Example: A sales dashboard showing real-time revenue by region, product, and customer type.


🔹 Lesson 3: Clustering with K-Means
========================================
Summary:
Clustering = grouping similar data points without labels.

Step 1: Choose k clusters
Step 2: Assign data to nearest centroid
Step 3: Recalculate centroids until stable

Example: Segment customers into “Budget, Regular, Premium” categories based on spending.


🔹 Lesson 4: Anomaly Detection
=====================================
Summary:
Detect unusual patterns that may indicate fraud, errors, or critical events.
Z-score method
Isolation Forest
Time-series anomaly detection

Example: Flagging suspicious transactions in bank data that deviate 5x from the normal transaction size.


🔹 Lesson 5: Case Study – Healthcare Analytics
============================================
Summary:
Steps:
------
Collect patient health records
Cluster patients with similar risk factors
Detect anomalies in medical test results
Present results via an interactive dashboard

Example: A hospital reduced ICU readmission rates by 12% using clustering + anomaly detection.
